1) Installation 
npm istall
2) Gatsby cli
Gatsby develop
================

1) Starter for Gatsby.js with Bootstrap enabled (only bootstrap-grid.css for better optimization) + Styled Components. The fonts are connected locally, which gives about 10 performance points for PageSpeed Insights.

2) Also this Gatsby starter is optimized for SEO. In this starter, React Helmet and Seo components are immediately connected, which I collected from various sources and redid a little.

3)I hope you like it, I have included the fonts locally and left only Bootsrap grid. By removing its awful Root color.

4)This layout was developed on the basis of my project electrickiev.com site for a professional electrician from Ukraine. But much has been removed as unnecessary, only the general concept is given here.
